* Making a video

** ~ffmpeg~

To create a video, ~ffmpeg~ can be used to concatenate many screenshots
in a single ~mp4~ file. To do so, use the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC <shell>
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i toto.txt -framerate 60 foobar.mp4
#+END_SRC

This command will take the file ~toto.txt~ as an input to know what files
need to be concatenated and in what order.

** Producing the sorted file

To create the file used by ~ffmpeg~, the ouput of the ~recorder~ command
can be parsed and piped in a text file. By default, ~recorder~ ouputs the
full paths towards the screenshots[fn:1]. Since the instruction file will be in
the same directory as the screenshots, only the filenames are required.

To parse the output, ~awk~ can be used like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC <shell>
awk '{ if ($1 != "Running"); split($1,line,"/"); printf "file %s\n", line[2];}' > toto/toto.txt
#+END_SRC

* Footnotes

[fn:1] This is due to the [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-mass-screenshots][library]] used by the ~recorder~ to capture
screenshots.
